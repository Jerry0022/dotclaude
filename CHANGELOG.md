# Changelog

## [0.2.4] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `self-calibration`: audit now checks full completion flow execution (verify → issue status → card → ship recommendation), not just whether a card was directly rendered

## [0.2.3] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- `stale-changes-check`: converted from daily cron to `SessionStart` hook (`ss.branches.check.js`) — runs at every session start, silent when clean, brief inline warning only when issues are found

## [0.2.2] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `refresh-usage`: autonomous CDP activation on exit 5 — Edge restart happens automatically instead of silent [no data] fallback; clear German instruction shown if restart fails

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Self-heal relative hook paths on session start — prevents MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors in consumer projects with old installations

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `prompt.ship.detect` hook: detect ship intent in user prompts, enforce Skill("ship")
- `prompt.start.detect` hook: detect app start intent, enforce completion card
- Ship enforcement via three layers: prompt detection, PR command blocking, completion flow

### Changed
- `pre.ship.guard` v0.3.0: now blocks manual PR commands, redirects to /ship
- `stop.flow.completion` v0.4.0: injects full completion template with all 7 variants
- README updated: 13 hooks, features section reflects ship enforcement and completion flow

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `pre.ship.guard` now blocks push when hooks in `hooks.json` are missing from `plugin.json`

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- PostToolUse and Stop hooks now share state correctly via Claude Code's `session_id`
- `stop.flow.completion` now reads stdin (was missing, breaking session_id access)
- Added `stop.flow.completion` to hooks registry in `plugin.json` and `hooks.json`

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Version references now stay consistent across all plugin files
