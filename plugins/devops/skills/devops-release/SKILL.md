# Release — Channel Promotion

Promote a shipped version to a higher channel. Ship publishes every version
to **alpha** autonomously; this skill is the deliberate half of the ring
model (spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-tag-channel-system-design.md`).

> **CRITICAL — `cwd` is required on every MCP tool call.**
> The ship MCP server runs in the plugin directory, NOT the target repo.
> Every `ship_promote` call MUST include `cwd` set to the current working
> directory of this Claude session.

## Step 0 — Load deferred MCP schema

`ship_promote` may be deferred. Load it first:

```
ToolSearch({ query: "select:mcp__plugin_devops_dotclaude-ship__ship_promote", max_results: 5 })
```

If the tool is not registered → STOP and report (do NOT fall back to manual
`git tag` — the promotion guards live in the tool).

## Step 1 — Gather channel state

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin
```

Parse tag names (`alpha/vX.Y.Z`, `beta/vX.Y.Z`, `stable/vX.Y.Z`, bare
`vX.Y.Z` = stable alias) and compute the latest version per channel by
**numeric** version comparison — never lexicographic, never
`--sort=v:refname` across channel prefixes.

Render ONE line:

```
Channels: alpha v0.117.0 · beta v0.114.0 · stable v0.112.0
```

If alpha has never shipped a channel tag → report "no channel tags yet —
ship something first" and stop.

## Step 2 — Ask which promotion

Precompute only the **meaningful** promotions (source strictly ahead of
target). Present via AskUserQuestion, recommended option first:

- `alpha vX → beta` (Recommended when alpha > beta)
- `beta vY → stable`
- `alpha vX → stable (fast-track)` — legitimate skip; beta is optional
- Abbrechen

If NO promotion is meaningful (all channels equal) → report "all channels
are at vX — nothing to promote" and stop. Never promote autonomously, even
with `--autonomous` in the trigger.

## Step 3 — Execute

Single-step promotion:

```
ship_promote({ version: "0.117.0", from: "alpha", to: "beta", cwd: "<cwd>" })
```

**Fast-track** = TWO sequential calls so the ring invariant
(stable ⊆ beta ⊆ alpha) always holds:

1. `ship_promote({ version, from: "alpha", to: "beta", cwd })`
2. `ship_promote({ version, from: "beta", to: "stable", releaseNotes: "<CHANGELOG entry for the version>", cwd })`

For any promotion to `stable`, pass `releaseNotes` (read the version's
CHANGELOG.md entry) — used as fallback notes if release.yml did not create
the GitHub Release.

**Partial failure recovery:** re-run the SAME call(s). Every step is
skip-if-exists idempotent; an already-completed step returns
`alreadyPromoted: true` and the missing tags are completed
(`pushed`/`missing` in the result show exactly what happened).

**Guard errors are final** — do not work around them:
- `monotonicity: ...` → the target channel is already ahead; roll forward
  (ship a newer version) instead.
- `ancestry: ...` → the SHA is not on origin/main; something is wrong —
  investigate, never force.
- `... published tags are immutable` → never delete/move tags to "fix" this.

## Step 4 — Report

Render the completion card (`render_completion_card`, variant `ready`,
summary "promoted vX.Y.Z to <channel>"). Include:
- the new one-line channel state (re-run Step 1)
- for stable: whether the GitHub Release exists (`release: true`)
- any `userFinalTest` item for lagging consumers ("Consumer-Maschine:
  nächster SessionStart pinnt auf stable/vX.Y.Z")

## Rollback = roll forward

There is deliberately NO demote operation (immutable tags + latest-wins
resolution). A bad promotion is corrected by fixing on a branch, shipping a
new version (alpha), and fast-track promoting the fix.
