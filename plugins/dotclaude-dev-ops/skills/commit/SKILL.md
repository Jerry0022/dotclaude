  Create a conventional commit for staged/changed files — enforces type, scope,
  and co-author footer. Triggers on: "commit", "commit this", "save my changes",
  "check this in", "speicher das", "committe das", "einchecken", "amend",
  "update the last commit", "fix last commit". Do NOT trigger for push, PR,
  or ship operations.

# Commit

Create a well-formed conventional commit.

## Step 0 — Load Extensions

Silently check for optional overrides (do not surface "not found" in output):

1. Global skill extension: `~/.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` + `reference.md`
2. Project skill extension: `{project}/.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` + `reference.md`
3. Merge: project > global > plugin defaults

**Note on `disable-model-invocation: true`:** This skill is only triggered by
explicit user commands (`/commit`), never by model initiative. Extensions are
still loaded and merged normally — `disable-model-invocation` only controls
trigger behavior, not extension resolution.

## Step 1 — Detect intent

- **Amend**: user says "amend", "update last commit", "fix last commit" → amend flow in Step 8
- **Normal**: everything else → standard flow

## Step 2 — Survey changes

```bash
git status --short
```

Identify staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

## Step 3 — Smart staging

If nothing is staged:

- **≤5 changed files**: Run `git diff` to see changes, then stage all relevant files with `git add <specific files>`.
- **>5 changed files**: Use `AskUserQuestion` to present file groups and let the user choose. Group by directory or logical change.

**Rules:** Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`. See `deep-knowledge/git-hygiene.md`.

## Step 4 — Read staged diff

```bash
git diff --cached
```

Read all staged changes carefully — this informs type, scope, and message.

## Step 5 — Determine type and scope

**Type:**

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Internal restructure, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Tooling, deps, CI, config |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace |

**Scope:** The module, component, or subsystem most affected. Derive from the file paths and project structure — no hardcoded list.

## Step 6 — Write message

**Subject:** ≤72 chars, imperative mood, no period. Say what it does, not what changed.
- Bad: "Updated the login screen"
- Good: "add dark mode toggle to settings"

**Body** (optional but recommended): Explain the *why*, not the *what*. Wrap at 72 chars.

## Step 7 — Add co-author

Extract the model name from the current session's system prompt and format:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude {Model} <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Always detect dynamically — never hardcode a specific model version.

## Step 8 — Execute commit

**Normal:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <Model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Amend** (only when user explicitly requested):
```bash
git commit --amend -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <updated subject>

<updated body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <Model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Step 9 — Report

Show commit hash, title, and stats:

```bash
git log --oneline -1 && git diff --stat HEAD~1
```

## Rules

- Never use `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the issue and create a **new** commit — never `--amend` unless the user asks.
- Do not commit files that may contain secrets (`.env`, credentials, keys).
- Merge commits are out of scope — handle manually.
